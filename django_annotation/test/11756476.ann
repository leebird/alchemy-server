T34	Sentence 827 1120	In vitro, addition of a MIR2-glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein to purified E1 and E2 enzymes leads to transfer of ubiquitin (Ub) to GST-containing targets in an ATP-and E2-dependent fashion; this reaction is abolished by mutation of the Zn-coordinating residues of the PHD domain.
T35	Sentence 1121 1248	Thus, MIR2 defines a novel class of membrane-bound E3 Ub ligases that modulates the trafficking of host cell membrane proteins.

T30	Sentence 139 386	Kaposi' s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus encodes two transmembrane proteins (modulator of immune recognition [MIR] 1 and MIR2) that downregulate cell surface molecules (MHC-I, B7.2, and ICAM-1) involved in the immune recognition of infected cells.
T31	Sentence 387 505	This downregulation results from enhanced endocytosis and subsequent endolysosomal degradation of the target proteins.
T32	Sentence 506 701	Here, we show that expression of MIR1 and MIR2 leads to ubiquitination of the cytosolic tail of their target proteins and that ubiquitination is essential for their removal from the cell surface.
T33	Sentence 702 826	MIR1 and MIR2 both contain cytosolic zinc fingers of the PHD subfamily, and these structures are required for this activity.
